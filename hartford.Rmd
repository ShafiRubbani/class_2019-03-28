```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

```{r hartford_data}
hartford <- readRDS("https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:tr137st9964/tr137st9964_ct_hartford_2019_02_25.rds")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
